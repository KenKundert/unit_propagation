This is an package used to experiment with adding unit propagation to 
QuantiPhy_.  It currently employs simple-minded simplification rules that are 
relatively easy to fool.  Also, there is a strong emphasis on simple electrical 
unit scenarios.  Even so, it shows promise for use in well controlled settings.

Included in the package is a simple RPN calculator that allows you to explore 
the capabilities and limitation of the *unit propagation*.
