This is a package used to experiment with adding unit propagation to QuantiPhy_.  
It currently employs simple-minded simplification rules that are relatively easy 
to fool.  Also, there is a strong emphasis on simple electrical unit scenarios.  
Even so, it shows promise for use in well controlled settings.

Included in the package is a simple RPN calculator that allows you to explore 
the capabilities and limitation of the *unit propagation*.
