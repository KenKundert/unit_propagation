This is a package used to experiment with adding unit propagation to QuantiPhy_.  
It currently employs simple-minded simplification rules that are relatively easy 
to fool.  Also, there is a strong emphasis on simple electrical unit scenarios.  
Even so, it shows promise for use in well controlled settings.

Here is simple example::

    >>> from unit_propagation import UnitPropagatingQuantity as Quantity, QuantiPhyError

    >>> try:
    ...     v = Quantity("2.5V")
    ...     i = Quantity("100nA")
    ...     print(v/i)
    ... except QuantiPhyError as e:
    ...     print(f"error: {e!s}")
    25 Mâ„¦

Operations can also involve integers, floats and strings::

    >>> Kvco = Quantity(500e6, "Hz") / "500mV"
    >>> print(Kvco)
    1 GHz/V

    >>> Vdd = Quantity("2.5V")
    >>> halfVdd = Vdd / 2
    >>> print(halfVdd)
    1.25 V

Included in the package is a simple RPN calculator that allows you to explore 
the capabilities and limitation of *unit propagation*.
